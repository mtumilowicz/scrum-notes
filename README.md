# scrum-notes
* authors: Ken Schwaber, Jeff Sutherland
    * two of the 17 initial signatories of the Agile Manifesto
* purpose of the Scrum Guide
    *  framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products
    
## introduction
* since the early 1990s
* is not: process, technique, definitive method
* is rather: framework within you can employ various processes and techniques
* used in
    * research and identify viable markets, technologies, and product capabilities
    * develop products and enhancements
        * release as frequently as many times per day
    * develop and sustain Cloud
    * sustain and renew products
* almost everything we use in our daily lives
* especially effective in iterative and incremental knowledge transfer
* essence of Scrum is a small team of people
    * small team is highly flexible and adaptive
* scrum values
    * commitment, courage, focus, openness and respect
    * trust: transparency, inspection, and adaptation
    
## Scrum Theory
* founded on empiricism
* employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk
* three pillars
    * transparency
        * aspects of the process 
            * visible to those responsible for the outcome
            * defined by a common standard
                * example - definition of "Done"
    * inspection
        * inspect artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal 
        * inspection should not slow down the work
        * by skilled inspectors
    * adaptation
        * caused by inspection
            * if resulting product will be unacceptable
            * if some aspects deviate outside acceptable limits
        * must be made as soon as possible
        * process or the material being processed must be adjusted
    * events for inspection and adaptation
        * Planning
        * Daily
        * Review
        * Retrospective

## Scrum Team
* self-organizing - not directed by others outside the team
    * chooses how best to accomplish their work
* cross-functional
    * has all competencies
* deliver products iteratively and incrementally, maximizing opportunities for feedback
### The Product Owner
* is one person
* responsible for maximizing the value of the product
* sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog
    * PO may have the Development Team do it, but remains accountable
    * clearly expressing Product Backlog items
    * assign priorities to items
    * optimizing the value of the work the Development Team performs
    * ensure that PB is visible, transparent, and clear to all
    * ensuring the Development Team understands items
### The Development Team
* only Development Team create the Increment
* self-organizing
    * knows how to turn Product Backlog into Increments
* cross-functional
    * all the skills to create a product Increment
* no titles for members
* no sub-teams
* size: 3-9 - Product Owner and Scrum Master roles are not included
    * small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint
### The Scrum Master
* help everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules, and values
* servant-leader for the Scrum Team
* helps those outside the Scrum Team understand which of their interactions with the Scrum Team 
are helpful and which aren’t
    * helps change these interactions to maximize the value
* service to Product Owner
    * understand product planning in an empirical environment
    * facilitate Scrum events as requested or needed
    * find techniques for effective Product Backlog management
    * understand and practice agility
    * ensure that artifacts are understood by everyone on the Scrum Team
* service to the Development Team
    * coaching in self-organization and cross-functionality
    * remove impediments to the Development Team’s progress
    * facilitates Scrum events
* service to the Organization
    * coaching in Scrum adoption
    * plan Scrum implementations within the organization
    * helps stakeholders understand and enact Scrum product management
    * Causing change that increases the productivity of the Scrum Team
    * cooperate with other Scrum Masters to increase the effectiveness of the application of Scrum
    
## Scrum Events
### The Sprint
* new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint
* once a Sprint begins, its duration cannot be changed
* are used to accomplish something
* time-box: <= month
    * may be considered a project with no more than a one-month horizon
    * when too long complexity may rise, and risk may increase
    * limit risk to one calendar month of cost
* during it - "Done", useable, product Increment is created
* consist of
    * Planning, 
    * Daily Scrums, 
    * the development work, 
    * Review
    * Retrospective
* no changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal
* quality goals do not decrease
* scope may be clarified and re-negotiated as more is learned: Product Owner <-> Development Team
* enable predictability by ensuring inspection and adaptation of progress toward a Sprint Goal 
* cancelling a Sprint
    * only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint
    * only ongoing sprint
    * if it no longer makes sense given the circumstances
        * for example - if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete
    * any completed and "Done" Product Backlog items are reviewed
        * incomplete Items are re-estimated and put back on the Product Backlog
        
### Planning
* by Scrum Team
* time-boxed: <= eight hours for a one-month Sprint
* answers the following:
    * What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?
    * How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?
* Topic One: What can be done this Sprint?
    * Development Team works to forecast the functionality that will be developed during the
      Sprint
    * Product Owner discusses the objective that the Sprint should achieve and the
      Product Backlog items that, if completed in the Sprint, would achieve the Sprint Goal
    * input to this meeting: 
        * Product Backlog
        * latest product Increment
        * projected capacity of the Development Team
        * past performance of the Development Team
    * number of items selected from the Product Backlog for the Sprint is solely up to the
      Development Team
        * Only the Development Team can assess what it can accomplish over the upcoming Sprint
    * During Sprint Planning the Scrum Team also crafts a Sprint Goal
        * Sprint Goal is an objective that will be met within the Sprint through the implementation 
        of the Product Backlog
            * Sprint Goal provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment
* Topic Two: How will the chosen work get done?
    * Sprint Backlog = Product Backlog items selected for this Sprint + the plan for delivering
    * Work planned for the first days of the Sprint by the Development Team is decomposed by the end 
    of this meeting, often to units of one day or less

### Sprint Goal
* is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of Product Backlog
* provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment
* created during the Sprint Planning meeting
* selected Product Backlog items deliver one coherent function, which can be the Sprint Goal
* can be any other coherence that causes the Development Team to work together rather than on separate 
initiatives

### Daily Scrum
* is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team
* is held every day of the Sprint
* at it, the Development Team plans work for the next 24 hours
* optimizes team collaboration and performance by inspecting the work since the last Daily Scrum
* forecasts upcoming Sprint work
* is held at the same time and place each day to reduce complexity
* Development Team uses the Daily Scrum to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and to inspect how 
progress is trending toward completing the work in the Sprint Backlog
* optimizes the probability that the Development Team will meet the Sprint Goal
* is set by the Development Team and can be conducted in different ways if it focuses on progress 
toward the Sprint Goal
    * What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
    * What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
    * Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal?
* Development Team or team members often meet immediately after the Daily Scrum for
  detailed discussions, or to adapt, or replan, the rest of the Sprint’s work
* Scrum Master ensures that the Development Team has the meeting
* Development Team is responsible for conducting the Daily Scrum
* is an internal meeting for the Development Team
    * If others are present, the Scrum Master ensures that they do not disrupt the meeting
* improve communications, eliminate other meetings, identify impediments to
  development for removal, highlight and promote quick decision-making, and improve the
  Development Team’s level of knowledge
* is a key inspect and adapt meeting

### Review
* is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed
* the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint
* is an informal meeting, not a status meeting, and the presentation of the Increment is intended to 
elicit feedback and foster collaboratioN
* at most a four-hour meeting for one-month Sprints
* includes the following elements:
    * Attendees include the Scrum Team and key stakeholders invited by the Product Owner
    * The Product Owner explains what Product Backlog items have been “Done” and what has not been “Done”;
    * The Development Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it ran into, and 
    how those problems were solved;
    * The Development Team demonstrates the work that it has “Done” and answers questions about the 
    Increment;
    * The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands
        * He or she projects likely target and delivery dates based on progress to date (if needed);
    * The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the Sprint Review provides
    valuable input to subsequent Sprint Planning;
    * Review of how the marketplace or potential use of the product might have changed what is
    the most valuable thing to do next
    * Review of the timeline, budget, potential capabilities, and marketplace for the next
    anticipated releases of functionality or capability of the product
* result of the Sprint Review is a revised Product Backlog that defines the probable Product
  Backlog items for the next Sprint
    * Product Backlog may also be adjusted overall to meet new opportunities

### Retrospective
* is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan
  for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint
* occurs after the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning
* at most a three-hour meeting for one-month Sprints
* Scrum Master ensures that the event takes place and that attendants understand its purpose
* Scrum Master ensures that the meeting is positive and productive
* The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to:
    * Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools;
    * Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements; and,
    * Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its work.
* By the end of the Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team should have identified improvements
  that it will implement in the next Sprint
    * Implementing these improvements in the next Sprint is the adaptation to the inspection of the 
    Scrum Team itself

## Scrum Artifacts
* represent work or value to provide transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaptation
* specifically designed to maximize transparency of key information so that everybody has the same understanding 
of the artifact

### Product Backlog
* is an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product
* is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product
* Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog, including its content, availability, and ordering
* is never complete
* constantly changes to identify what the product needs to be appropriate, competitive, and useful
* lists all features, functions, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that constitute the changes to be made 
to the product in future releases
* items have the attributes of a description, order, estimate, and value
    * often include test descriptions that will prove its completeness when “Done.”
* is used to describe the upcoming work on the product
* Product Backlog refinement 
    * is the act of adding detail, estimates, and order to items in the Product Backlog
    * is an ongoing process in which the Product Owner and the Development Team collaborate on the details 
    of Product Backlog item
    * items are reviewed and revised
    * Scrum Team decides how and when refinement is done
    * usually consumes no more than 10% of the capacity of the Development Team
    * Product Backlog items can be updated at any time by the Product Owner or at the Product Owner’s discretion
* Higher ordered Product Backlog items are usually clearer and more detailed than lower ordered ones
* Product Backlog items that will occupy the Development Team
  for the upcoming Sprint are refined so that any one item can reasonably be “Done” within the
  Sprint time-box
* Product Backlog items that can be “Done” by the Development Team within
  one Sprint are deemed “Ready” for selection in a Sprint Planning
* Development Team is responsible for all estimates
    * people who will perform the work make the final estimate
* Monitoring Progress Toward Goals
    * Product Owner tracks this total work remaining at least every Sprint Review
    * burn-downs, burn-ups, or cumulative flows

### Sprint Backlog
* is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for
  delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal
* is a forecast
  by the Development Team about what functionality will be in the next Increment and the work
  needed to deliver that functionality into a “Done” Increment
* Sprint Backlog makes visible all the work that the Development Team identifies as necessary
  to meet the Sprint Goal
* To ensure continuous improvement, it includes at least one high
  priority process improvement identified in the previous Retrospective meeting
* Development Team modifies the Sprint Backlog throughout the Sprint, and
 the Sprint Backlog emerges during the Sprint
* emergence occurs as the Development Team works through the plan and learns more about the work needed to 
achieve the Sprint Goal
* As new work is required, the Development Team adds it to the Sprint Backlog
* As work is performed or completed, the estimated remaining work is updated
* Only the Development Team can change its Sprint Backlog during a Sprint
* is a highly visible, real-time picture of the work that the Development Team plans to accomplish during 
the Sprint, and it belongs solely to the Development Team
* Monitoring Sprint Progress
    * Development Team tracks this total work remaining at least for every Daily Scrum to project
      the likelihood of achieving the Sprint Goal
    * By tracking the remaining work throughout the
      Sprint, the Development Team can manage its progress
* Increment
    * is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the
      value of the increments of all previous Sprints
    * At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be “Done,”
        * it must be in useable condition and meet the Scrum Team’s definition of “Done.”
    * is a step toward a vision or goal
    * must be in useable condition regardless of whether the Product Owner decides to release it

### Artifact Transparency
* Scrum relies on transparency
* Scrum Master’s job is to work with the Scrum Team and the organization to increase the
  transparency of the artifacts
* Definition of “Done”
    * everyone must understand what “Done” means
    * Development Teams deliver an Increment of product functionality every Sprint
        * Increment is useable, so a Product Owner may choose to immediately release it
    * Development Team must define a definition of “Done”
        * if not a convention of the development organization
    * As Scrum Teams mature, it is expected that their definitions of “Done” will expand to include
      more stringent criteria for higher quality
    * Any one product or system should have a definition of
      “Done” that is a standard for any work done on it
