# scrum-guide-summary
* authors: Ken Schwaber, Jeff Sutherland
    * two of the 17 initial signatories of the Agile Manifesto
* Purpose of the Scrum Guide
    *  framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products
* Definition of Scrum
    * since the early 1990s
    * not a process, technique, or definitive method
        * rather: framework within you can employ various processes and techniques
* Uses of Scrum
    * used extensively
        * Research and identify viable markets, technologies, and product capabilities
        * Develop products and enhancements;
        * Release products and enhancements, as frequently as many times per day;
        * Develop and sustain Cloud (online, secure, on-demand) and other operational
        environments for product use; and,
        * Sustain and renew products.
    * develop software, hardware, embedded software, networks of
      interacting function, autonomous vehicles, schools, government, marketing, managing the
      operation of organizations and almost everything we use in our daily lives, as individuals and
      societies
    * especially effective in iterative and incremental knowledge transfer
    * essence of Scrum is a small team of people
        * small team is highly flexible and adaptive
* Scrum Theory
    * founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism
        * knowledge comes from experience
    * employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk
    * Three pillars
        * transparency
            * aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome
            * requires those aspects be defined by a common standard
                * common language referring to the process must be shared by all participants
                * common definition of “Done”
        * inspection
            * users must frequently inspect Scrum artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal to detect
              undesirable variances
            * inspection should not be so frequent that inspection gets in the way of the work
            * most beneficial when diligently performed by skilled inspectors
        * adaptation
            * process or the material being processed must be adjusted
                * if an inspector determines that one or more aspects of a process deviate outside 
                acceptable limits
                * if resulting product will be unacceptable
            * adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation
            * four formal events for inspection and adaptation
                * Sprint Planning
                * Daily Scrum
                * Sprint Review
                * Sprint Retrospective
* Scrum Values
    * commitment, courage, focus, openness and respect
    * transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life and build trust for everyone
* The Scrum Team
    * self-organizing - choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by 
    others outside the team
    * cross-functional - all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not
    part of the team
    * deliver products iteratively and incrementally, maximizing opportunities for feedback
    * The Product Owner
        * responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from work of the Development Team
            * How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals
        * is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog
        * Product Backlog management includes:
            * clearly expressing Product Backlog items
            * ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions
            * optimizing the value of the work the Development Team performs
            * ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what
            the Scrum Team will work on next
            * ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed
            * Product Owner may do the above work, or have the Development Team do it
                * Product Owner remains accountable
        * Product Owner is one person, not a committee
        * No one can force the Development Team to work from a different set of requirements
    * The Development Team
        * “Done” increment is required at the Sprint Review
        * Only members of the Development Team create the Increment
        * self-organizing
            * no one tells the Development Team how to turn Product Backlog into Increments of 
            potentially releasable functionality
        * cross-functional
            * all the skills to create a product Increment
        * no titles for Development Team members
            * regardless of the work being performed by the person
        * no sub-teams in the Development Team
            * regardless of domains that need to be addressed like testing, architecture, operations, 
            or business analysis
        * members may have specialized skills and areas of focus, but accountability belongs to the 
        Development Team as a whole
        * Development Team Size
            * small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint
            * 3-9
                * Product Owner and Scrum Master roles are not included in this count unless
                 they are also executing the work of the Sprint Backlog
    * The Scrum Master
        * responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide
            * helping everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules, and values
        * servant-leader for the Scrum Team
        * helps those outside the Scrum Team understand which of their interactions with the Scrum Team 
        are helpful and which aren’t
            * helps everyone change these interactions to maximize the value
        * Scrum Master Service to the Product Owner
            * ensuring that goals, scope, and product domain are understood by everyone on the Scrum
              Team as well as possible
            * finding techniques for effective Product Backlog management
            * Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items
            * understanding product planning in an empirical environment
            * Ensuring the Product Owner knows how to arrange the Product Backlog to maximize value
            * Understanding and practicing agility
            * Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed
        * Scrum Master Service to the Development Team
            * Coaching the Development Team in self-organization and cross-functionality
            * Helping the Development Team to create high-value products
            * Removing impediments to the Development Team’s progress
            * Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed
            * Coaching the Development Team in organizational environments in which Scrum is not yet
            fully adopted and understood.
        * Scrum Master Service to the Organization
            * Leading and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption
            * Planning Scrum implementations within the organization
            * Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact Scrum and empirical product
            development
            * Causing change that increases the productivity of the Scrum Team
            * Working with other Scrum Masters to increase the effectiveness of the application of Scrum
            in the organization
* Scrum Events
    * Once a Sprint begins, its duration is fixed and cannot be shortened or lengthened
    * each event in Scrum is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt something
        * events are specifically designed to enable critical transparency and inspection
    * The Sprint
        * time-box of one month or less during which a “Done”, useable,
          and potentially releasable product Increment is created
        * new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint
        * consist of
            * Sprint Planning, 
            * Daily Scrums, 
            * the development work, 
            * the Sprint Review
            * the Sprint Retrospective
        * During the Sprint
            * No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal
            * Quality goals do not decrease
            * Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development
            Team as more is learned
        * Sprint may be considered a project with no more than a one-month horizon
            * Sprints are used to accomplish something
            * print has a goal of what is to be built and flexible plan that will guide building it
        * When a Sprint’s horizon is too long the definition of
          what is being built may change, complexity may rise, and risk may increase
        * enable predictability by ensuring inspection and adaptation of progress toward a Sprint Goal 
        at least every calendar month
        * limit risk to one calendar month of cost
        * Cancelling a Sprint
            * sprint can be cancelled before the Sprint time-box is over
            * Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint
            * sprint would be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete
                * might occur if the company changes direction or if market or technology conditions 
                change
            * Sprint should be cancelled if it no longer makes sense given the circumstances
            * due to the short duration of Sprints, cancellation rarely makes sense
            * When a Sprint is cancelled, any completed and “Done” Product Backlog items are reviewed
                * part of the work is potentially releasable, the Product Owner typically accepts it
                * All incomplete Product Backlog Items are re-estimated and put back on the Product Backlog
        * Sprint Planning
            * collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team
            * time-boxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint
            * Scrum Master ensures that the event takes place and that attendants understand its purpose
            * answers the following:
                * What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?
                * How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?
            * Topic One: What can be done this Sprint?
                * Development Team works to forecast the functionality that will be developed during the
                  Sprint
                * Product Owner discusses the objective that the Sprint should achieve and the
                  Product Backlog items that, if completed in the Sprint, would achieve the Sprint Goal
                * input to this meeting: 
                    * Product Backlog
                    * latest product Increment
                    * projected capacity of the Development Team
                    * past performance of the Development Team
                * number of items selected from the Product Backlog for the Sprint is solely up to the
                  Development Team
                    * Only the Development Team can assess what it can accomplish over the upcoming Sprint
                * During Sprint Planning the Scrum Team also crafts a Sprint Goal
                    * Sprint Goal is an objective that will be met within the Sprint through the implementation 
                    of the Product Backlog
                        * Sprint Goal provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment
            * Topic Two: How will the chosen work get done?
                * Sprint Backlog = Product Backlog items selected for this Sprint + the plan for delivering
                * Work planned for the first days of the Sprint by the Development Team is decomposed by the end 
                of this meeting, often to units of one day or less
        * Sprint Goal
            * is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of Product Backlog
            * provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment
            * created during the Sprint Planning meeting
            * selected Product Backlog items deliver one coherent function, which can be the Sprint Goal
            * can be any other coherence that causes the Development Team to work together rather than on separate 
            initiatives
        * Daily Scrum
            * is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team
            * is held every day of the Sprint
            * at it, the Development Team plans work for the next 24 hours
            * optimizes team collaboration and performance by inspecting the work since the last Daily Scrum
            * forecasts upcoming Sprint work
            * is held at the same time and place each day to reduce complexity
            * Development Team uses the Daily Scrum to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and to inspect how 
            progress is trending toward completing the work in the Sprint Backlog
            * optimizes the probability that the Development Team will meet the Sprint Goal
            * is set by the Development Team and can be conducted in different ways if it focuses on progress 
            toward the Sprint Goal
                * What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
                * What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
                * Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal?
            * Development Team or team members often meet immediately after the Daily Scrum for
              detailed discussions, or to adapt, or replan, the rest of the Sprint’s work
            * Scrum Master ensures that the Development Team has the meeting
            * Development Team is responsible for conducting the Daily Scrum
            * is an internal meeting for the Development Team
                * If others are present, the Scrum Master ensures that they do not disrupt the meeting
            * improve communications, eliminate other meetings, identify impediments to
              development for removal, highlight and promote quick decision-making, and improve the
              Development Team’s level of knowledge
            * is a key inspect and adapt meeting
        * Sprint Review
            * is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed
            * the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint
            * is an informal meeting, not a status meeting, and the presentation of the Increment is intended to 
            elicit feedback and foster collaboratioN
            * at most a four-hour meeting for one-month Sprints
            * includes the following elements:
                * Attendees include the Scrum Team and key stakeholders invited by the Product Owner
                * The Product Owner explains what Product Backlog items have been “Done” and what has not been “Done”;
                * The Development Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it ran into, and 
                how those problems were solved;
                * The Development Team demonstrates the work that it has “Done” and answers questions about the 
                Increment;
                * The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands
                    * He or she projects likely target and delivery dates based on progress to date (if needed);
                * The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the Sprint Review provides
                valuable input to subsequent Sprint Planning;
                * Review of how the marketplace or potential use of the product might have changed what is
                the most valuable thing to do next
                * Review of the timeline, budget, potential capabilities, and marketplace for the next
                anticipated releases of functionality or capability of the product
            * result of the Sprint Review is a revised Product Backlog that defines the probable Product
              Backlog items for the next Sprint
                * Product Backlog may also be adjusted overall to meet new opportunities
        * Sprint Retrospective
            * is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan
              for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint
            * occurs after the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning
            * at most a three-hour meeting for one-month Sprints
            * Scrum Master ensures that the event takes place and that attendants understand its purpose
            * Scrum Master ensures that the meeting is positive and productive
            * The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to:
                * Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools;
                * Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements; and,
                * Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its work.
            * By the end of the Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team should have identified improvements
              that it will implement in the next Sprint
                * Implementing these improvements in the next Sprint is the adaptation to the inspection of the 
                Scrum Team itself
* Scrum Artifacts
    * represent work or value to provide transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaptation
    * specifically designed to maximize transparency of key information so that everybody has the same understanding 
    of the artifact
    * Product Backlog
        * is an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product
        * is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product
        * Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog, including its content, availability, and ordering
        * is never complete
        * constantly changes to identify what the product needs to be appropriate, competitive, and useful
        * lists all features, functions, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that constitute the changes to be made 
        to the product in future releases
        * items have the attributes of a description, order, estimate, and value
            * often include test descriptions that will prove its completeness when “Done.”
        * is used to describe the upcoming work on the product
        * Product Backlog refinement 
            * is the act of adding detail, estimates, and order to items in the Product Backlog
            * is an ongoing process in which the Product Owner and the Development Team collaborate on the details 
            of Product Backlog item
            * items are reviewed and revised
            * Scrum Team decides how and when refinement is done
            * usually consumes no more than 10% of the capacity of the Development Team
            * Product Backlog items can be updated at any time by the Product Owner or at the Product Owner’s discretion
        * Higher ordered Product Backlog items are usually clearer and more detailed than lower ordered ones
        * Product Backlog items that will occupy the Development Team
          for the upcoming Sprint are refined so that any one item can reasonably be “Done” within the
          Sprint time-box
        * Product Backlog items that can be “Done” by the Development Team within
          one Sprint are deemed “Ready” for selection in a Sprint Planning
        * Development Team is responsible for all estimates
            * people who will perform the work make the final estimate
        * Monitoring Progress Toward Goals
            * Product Owner tracks this total work remaining at least every Sprint Review
            * burn-downs, burn-ups, or cumulative flows
    * Sprint Backlog
        * is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for
          delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal
        * is a forecast
          by the Development Team about what functionality will be in the next Increment and the work
          needed to deliver that functionality into a “Done” Increment
        * Sprint Backlog makes visible all the work that the Development Team identifies as necessary
          to meet the Sprint Goal
        * To ensure continuous improvement, it includes at least one high
          priority process improvement identified in the previous Retrospective meeting
        * Development Team modifies the Sprint Backlog throughout the Sprint, and
         the Sprint Backlog emerges during the Sprint
        * emergence occurs as the Development Team works through the plan and learns more about the work needed to 
        achieve the Sprint Goal
        * As new work is required, the Development Team adds it to the Sprint Backlog
        * As work is performed or completed, the estimated remaining work is updated
        * Only the Development Team can change its Sprint Backlog during a Sprint
        * is a highly visible, real-time picture of the work that the Development Team plans to accomplish during 
        the Sprint, and it belongs solely to the Development Team
        * Monitoring Sprint Progress
            * Development Team tracks this total work remaining at least for every Daily Scrum to project
              the likelihood of achieving the Sprint Goal
            * By tracking the remaining work throughout the
              Sprint, the Development Team can manage its progress
        * Increment
            * is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the
              value of the increments of all previous Sprints
            * At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be “Done,”
                * it must be in useable condition and meet the Scrum Team’s definition of “Done.”
            * is a step toward a vision or goal
            * must be in useable condition regardless of whether the Product Owner decides to release it
* Artifact Transparency
    * Scrum relies on transparency
    * Scrum Master’s job is to work with the Scrum Team and the organization to increase the
      transparency of the artifacts
    * Definition of “Done”
        * everyone must understand what “Done” means
        * Development Teams deliver an Increment of product functionality every Sprint
            * Increment is useable, so a Product Owner may choose to immediately release it
        * Development Team must define a definition of “Done”
            * if not a convention of the development organization
        * As Scrum Teams mature, it is expected that their definitions of “Done” will expand to include
          more stringent criteria for higher quality
        * Any one product or system should have a definition of
          “Done” that is a standard for any work done on it
