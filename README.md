# scrum-guide-summary
* authors: Ken Schwaber, Jeff Sutherland
    * two of the 17 initial signatories of the Agile Manifesto
* Purpose of the Scrum Guide
    *  framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products
* Definition of Scrum
    * since the early 1990s
    * not a process, technique, or definitive method
        * rather: framework within you can employ various processes and techniques
* Uses of Scrum
    * used extensively
        * Research and identify viable markets, technologies, and product capabilities
        * Develop products and enhancements;
        * Release products and enhancements, as frequently as many times per day;
        * Develop and sustain Cloud (online, secure, on-demand) and other operational
        environments for product use; and,
        * Sustain and renew products.
    * develop software, hardware, embedded software, networks of
      interacting function, autonomous vehicles, schools, government, marketing, managing the
      operation of organizations and almost everything we use in our daily lives, as individuals and
      societies
    * especially effective in iterative and incremental knowledge transfer
    * essence of Scrum is a small team of people
        * small team is highly flexible and adaptive
* Scrum Theory
    * founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism
        * knowledge comes from experience
    * employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk
    * Three pillars
        * transparency
            * aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome
            * requires those aspects be defined by a common standard
                * common language referring to the process must be shared by all participants
                * common definition of “Done”
        * inspection
            * users must frequently inspect Scrum artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal to detect
              undesirable variances
            * inspection should not be so frequent that inspection gets in the way of the work
            * most beneficial when diligently performed by skilled inspectors
        * adaptation
            * process or the material being processed must be adjusted
                * if an inspector determines that one or more aspects of a process deviate outside 
                acceptable limits
                * if resulting product will be unacceptable
            * adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation
            * four formal events for inspection and adaptation
                * Sprint Planning
                * Daily Scrum
                * Sprint Review
                * Sprint Retrospective
* Scrum Values
    * commitment, courage, focus, openness and respect
    * transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life and build trust for everyone
* The Scrum Team
    * self-organizing - choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by 
    others outside the team
    * cross-functional - all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not
    part of the team
    * deliver products iteratively and incrementally, maximizing opportunities for feedback
    * The Product Owner
        * responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from work of the Development Team
            * How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals
        * is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog
        * Product Backlog management includes:
            * clearly expressing Product Backlog items
            * ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions
            * optimizing the value of the work the Development Team performs
            * ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what
            the Scrum Team will work on next
            * ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed
            * Product Owner may do the above work, or have the Development Team do it
                * Product Owner remains accountable
        * Product Owner is one person, not a committee
        * No one can force the Development Team to work from a different set of requirements
    * The Development Team
        * “Done” increment is required at the Sprint Review
        * Only members of the Development Team create the Increment
        * self-organizing
            * no one tells the Development Team how to turn Product Backlog into Increments of 
            potentially releasable functionality
        * cross-functional
            * all the skills to create a product Increment
        * no titles for Development Team members
            * regardless of the work being performed by the person
        * no sub-teams in the Development Team
            * regardless of domains that need to be addressed like testing, architecture, operations, 
            or business analysis
        * members may have specialized skills and areas of focus, but accountability belongs to the 
        Development Team as a whole
        * Development Team Size
            * small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint
            * 3-9
                * Product Owner and Scrum Master roles are not included in this count unless
                 they are also executing the work of the Sprint Backlog
    * The Scrum Master
        * responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide
            * helping everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules, and values
        * servant-leader for the Scrum Team
        * helps those outside the Scrum Team understand which of their interactions with the Scrum Team 
        are helpful and which aren’t
            * helps everyone change these interactions to maximize the value
        * Scrum Master Service to the Product Owner
            * ensuring that goals, scope, and product domain are understood by everyone on the Scrum
              Team as well as possible
            * finding techniques for effective Product Backlog management
            * Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items
            * understanding product planning in an empirical environment
            * Ensuring the Product Owner knows how to arrange the Product Backlog to maximize value
            * Understanding and practicing agility
            * Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed
        * Scrum Master Service to the Development Team
            * Coaching the Development Team in self-organization and cross-functionality
            * Helping the Development Team to create high-value products
            * Removing impediments to the Development Team’s progress
            * Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed
            * Coaching the Development Team in organizational environments in which Scrum is not yet
            fully adopted and understood.
        * Scrum Master Service to the Organization
            * Leading and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption
            * Planning Scrum implementations within the organization
            * Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact Scrum and empirical product
            development
            * Causing change that increases the productivity of the Scrum Team
            * Working with other Scrum Masters to increase the effectiveness of the application of Scrum
            in the organization
* Scrum Events
    * Once a Sprint begins, its duration is fixed and cannot be shortened or lengthened
    * each event in Scrum is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt something
        * events are specifically designed to enable critical transparency and inspection
    * The Sprint
        * time-box of one month or less during which a “Done”, useable,
          and potentially releasable product Increment is created
        * new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint
        * consist of
            * Sprint Planning, 
            * Daily Scrums, 
            * the development work, 
            * the Sprint Review
            * the Sprint Retrospective
        * During the Sprint
            * No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal
            * Quality goals do not decrease
            * Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development
            Team as more is learned
        * Sprint may be considered a project with no more than a one-month horizon
            * Sprints are used to accomplish something
            * print has a goal of what is to be built and flexible plan that will guide building it
        * When a Sprint’s horizon is too long the definition of
          what is being built may change, complexity may rise, and risk may increase
        * enable predictability by ensuring inspection and adaptation of progress toward a Sprint Goal 
        at least every calendar month
        * limit risk to one calendar month of cost
        * Cancelling a Sprint
            * sprint can be cancelled before the Sprint time-box is over
            * Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint
            * sprint would be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete
                * might occur if the company changes direction or if market or technology conditions 
                change
            * Sprint should be cancelled if it no longer makes sense given the circumstances
            * due to the short duration of Sprints, cancellation rarely makes sense
