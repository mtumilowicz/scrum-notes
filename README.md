# scrum-guide-summary
* authors: Ken Schwaber, Jeff Sutherland
    * two of the 17 initial signatories of the Agile Manifesto
* Purpose of the Scrum Guide
    *  framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products
* Definition of Scrum
    * since the early 1990s
    * not a process, technique, or definitive method
        * rather: framework within you can employ various processes and techniques
* Uses of Scrum
    * used extensively
        * Research and identify viable markets, technologies, and product capabilities
        * Develop products and enhancements;
        * Release products and enhancements, as frequently as many times per day;
        * Develop and sustain Cloud (online, secure, on-demand) and other operational
        environments for product use; and,
        * Sustain and renew products.
    * develop software, hardware, embedded software, networks of
      interacting function, autonomous vehicles, schools, government, marketing, managing the
      operation of organizations and almost everything we use in our daily lives, as individuals and
      societies
    * especially effective in iterative and incremental knowledge transfer
    * essence of Scrum is a small team of people
        * small team is highly flexible and adaptive
* Scrum Theory
    * founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism
        * knowledge comes from experience
    * employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk
    * Three pillars
        * transparency
            * aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome
            * requires those aspects be defined by a common standard
                * common language referring to the process must be shared by all participants
                * common definition of “Done”
        * inspection
            * users must frequently inspect Scrum artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal to detect
              undesirable variances
            * inspection should not be so frequent that inspection gets in the way of the work
            * most beneficial when diligently performed by skilled inspectors
        * adaptation
            * process or the material being processed must be adjusted
                * if an inspector determines that one or more aspects of a process deviate outside 
                acceptable limits
                * if resulting product will be unacceptable
            * adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation
            * four formal events for inspection and adaptation
                * Sprint Planning
                * Daily Scrum
                * Sprint Review
                * Sprint Retrospective
* Scrum Values
    * commitment, courage, focus, openness and respect
    * transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life and build trust for everyone
* The Scrum Team
    * self-organizing - choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by 
    others outside the team
    * cross-functional - all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not
    part of the team
    * deliver products iteratively and incrementally, maximizing opportunities for feedback
    * The Product Owner
        * responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from work of the Development Team
        * How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams,
          and individuals
