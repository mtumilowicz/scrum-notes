# scrum-notes
* authors: Ken Schwaber, Jeff Sutherland
    * two of the 17 initial signatories of the Agile Manifesto
* purpose of the Scrum Guide
    * framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products
    
## introduction
* since the early 1990s
* Scrum is not: process, technique, definitive method
    * is rather: framework within you can employ various processes and techniques
    * framework for dealing with complexity
    * framework for optimizing decision making (based on the knowledge and experience of the entire team)
* used in
    * research, technologies, product capabilities
    * develop, sustain and renew products
        * release as frequently as many times per day
    * almost everything we use in our daily lives
* especially effective in iterative and incremental knowledge transfer
* essence of Scrum is a small team of people
    * small team is highly flexible and adaptive
* scrum values
    * commitment, courage, focus, openness and respect
    * trust: transparency, inspection, and adaptation
    
## Scrum Theory
* founded on empiricism
* employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk
* Scrum is meant to be implemented as prescribed in the Scrum Guide
    * five events in the Scrum Guide are mandatory - each has a specific purpose
* three pillars
    * transparency
        * aspects of the process are visible to those responsible for the outcome
        * aspects of the process defined by a common standard
            * example - definition of "Done"
    * inspection
        * by skilled inspectors
        * inspect artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal 
        * inspection should not slow down the work
    * adaptation
        * caused by inspection, when
            * resulting product will be unacceptable
            * some aspects deviate outside acceptable limits
        * must be made as soon as possible
    * events for inspection and adaptation
        * Planning
        * Daily
        * Review
        * Retrospective
* role of Management in Scrum
    * supports the Product Owner with insights and information into high value product 
    and system capabilities
    * supports the Scrum Master to cause organizational change that fosters empiricism, 
    self-organization, bottom-up intelligence, and intelligent release of software
    
## Scrum Team
* designed to optimize flexibility, creativity, and productivity
* consists of
    * Scrum Master (manages the process)
    * Product Owner (decides what to do)
    * Development Team (does the work)
    * Product Owner or the Scrum Master can do development work
        * it is not the best practice because it could create a conflict of interest
* self-organizing - not directed by others outside the team
    * chooses how to accomplish their work
* cross-functional
    * has all competencies
* deliver products iteratively and incrementally, maximizing opportunities for feedback

### Product Owner
* is one person
* responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the Development Team
* sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog
    * PO may have the Development Team do it, but remains accountable
    * clearly expressing Product Backlog items
    * assigning priorities to items
    * ensuring that PB is visible, transparent, and clear to all
    * ensuring the Development Team understands items
* knows the most about the progress toward a business objective or a release, and be able to 
explain the alternatives most clearly
    
### Development Team
* only Development Team create the Increment
* self-organizing
    * knows how to turn Product Backlog into Increments
* cross-functional
    * has all the skills to create an Increment
* no titles for members
* no sub-teams
* size: 3-9 - Product Owner and Scrum Master roles are not included
    * small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint

### Scrum Master
* helps everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules, and values
* facilitates Scrum events
* servant-leader for the Scrum Team
* helps those outside the Scrum Team understand which of their interactions with the Scrum Team 
are helpful and which aren’t
    * helps change these interactions to maximize the value
* works with the Scrum Team and the organization to increase the transparency of the artifacts
    * ensures that artifacts are understood by everyone on the Scrum Team
* service to Product Owner
    * understands product planning in an empirical environment
    * finds techniques for effective Product Backlog management
    * understands and practice agility
* service to the Development Team
    * coaching in self-organization and cross-functionality
    * removes impediments to the Development Team’s progress
    * helps the Development Team to create high-value products
    * teach to keep the Daily Scrum within the 15 minute time-box
        * ensures that the Development Team has the meeting
        * ensures that the others do not disrupt the meeting
* service to the Organization
    * coaching in Scrum adoption
    * plans Scrum implementations within the organization
    * helps stakeholders understand and enact Scrum product management
    * causing change that increases the productivity of the Scrum Team
    * cooperates with other Scrum Masters to increase the effectiveness of the application of Scrum
    * is responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide
    
## Scrum Events
* every event in Scrum, besides the Sprint which is a container for the other events, is an opportunity 
to Inspect and Adapt

### Sprint
* time-box: <= month
    * may be considered a project with no more than a one-month horizon
    * when too long complexity may rise, and risk may increase
    * limits risk to one calendar month of cost
    * short enough to keep the business risk acceptable to the Product Owner
    * short enough to be able to synchronize the development work with other business events
* new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint
* once a Sprint begins, its duration cannot be changed
* used to accomplish something
* during it - "Done", useable, product Increment is created
* consist of
    * Planning
    * Daily Scrums
    * the development work
    * Review
    * Retrospective
* no changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal
* quality goals do not decrease
* scope may be clarified and re-negotiated as more is learned: Product Owner <-> Development Team
* enables predictability by ensuring inspection and adaptation of progress toward a Sprint Goal 
* cancelling a Sprint
    * Product Owner authority
    * only ongoing sprint
    * if it no longer makes sense given the circumstances
        * for example - if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete
    * any completed and "Done" Product Backlog items are reviewed
        * incomplete Items are re-estimated and put back on the Product Backlog
* at the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be "Done"
    * in useable condition
        * regardless of whether the Product Owner decides to release it
* Development Team during the first Sprint
    * develops and delivers at least one piece of functionality
    * delivers an increment of potentially releasable software
           
### Planning
* time-boxed: <= eight hours for a one-month Sprint
* attendees: Scrum Team
    * Development Team may invite other people to attend to provide technical or domain advice
* input to this meeting
    * Product Backlog
    * latest product Increment
    * projected capacity of the Development Team
    * past performance of the Development Team
* answers the question: what can be done?
    * Product Owner discusses the objective that the Sprint should achieve and the Product Backlog 
    items that would achieve the Sprint Goal
    * number of items selected is solely up to the Development Team
        * only the Development Team can assess what it can accomplish
    * Scrum Team crafts a Sprint Goal
* how will the chosen work get done?
    * Sprint Backlog = Product Backlog items selected for this Sprint + the plan for delivering
    * by the end of planning: Development Team decomposes work planned for the first days
        * often to units of one day or less
* by the end of the Sprint Planning, the Development Team should be able to explain to the
  Product Owner and Scrum Master how it intends to work as a self-organizing team to
  accomplish the Sprint Goal and create the anticipated Increment

### Sprint Goal
* created during the Sprint Planning meeting
* is an objective that can be met through the implementation of Product Backlog
* provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment
* causes the Development Team to work together rather than on separate initiatives

### Daily Scrum
* time-boxed: <= 15 min
    * it does not change with the length of a Sprint
* is a key inspect and adapt meeting
* internal meeting for the Development Team
    * Development Team is responsible for conducting the Daily Scrum
    * Scrum Master ensures that others (if any) do not disrupt the meeting
* held every day of the Sprint
* forecasts upcoming work
* plans work for the next 24 hours
* optimizes team collaboration and performance by inspecting the work since the last Daily Scrum
* is held at the same time and place each day to reduce complexity
* inspects progress toward the Sprint Goal
* inspects how progress is trending toward completing the work in the Sprint Backlog
* optimizes the probability that the Development Team will meet the Sprint Goal
* questions
    * what did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
    * what will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
    * do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal?
* Development Team or team members often meet immediately after the Daily Scrum for
  detailed discussions, or to adapt, or replan
* pros
    * improves communications
    * eliminates other meetings
    * identifies impediments to development
    * highlights and promotes quick decision-making
    * improves the Development Team’s level of knowledge

### Review
* time-box: <= 4h for one-month Sprints
* attendees: Scrum Team + key stakeholders invited by the Product Owner
* Scrum Team and stakeholders inspect the outcome of a Sprint and figure out what to do next
* held at the end of the Sprint
    * inspect: Increment
    * adapt: Product Backlog (if needed)
* Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done
* presentation of the Increment, feedback
    * is an informal meeting, not a status meeting
* entire group collaborates on what to do next
    * valuable input to subsequent Planning
* review of the timeline, budget, potential capabilities, and marketplace
* result of the Sprint Review is a revised Product Backlog
* roles
    * Product Owner
        * explains what items have been "Done" and what has not been "Done"
        * discusses the Product Backlog
        * if needed: projects likely target and delivery dates based on progress
    * Development Team
        * discusses what went well
        * discusses problems and how were solved
        * demonstrates the "Done" work
        * answers questions about the Increment

### Retrospective
* time-boxed: <= 3h for one-month Sprints
* attendees: Scrum Team
    * Product Owner must be present
* occurs after the Review and prior to the next Planning
* inspect how the last Sprint went
    * regards to people, relationships, process, and tools
* create a plan for implementing improvements in the next Sprint
    * adaptation to the inspection of the Scrum Team itself
* identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements

## Scrum Artifacts
* designed to maximize transparency of key information
* are Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog and Increment

### Product Backlog
* Product Owner responsibility
    * including content, availability, and ordering
    * items can be updated at any time by the Product Owner or at the Product Owner’s discretion
* product have one Product Backlog, regardless of how many teams are used
* used to describe the upcoming work on the product
* ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product
    * lists all features, functions, requirements, enhancements, and fixes
    * items have the attributes of a description, order, estimate, and value
        * often include test descriptions that will prove its completeness when "Done"
    * higher ordered Product Backlog items are usually clearer
* single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product
* is never complete
* constantly changes
* refinement
    * design, decomposition, analysis
    * items are reviewed and revised
        * act of adding detail, estimates, and order to items
    * Scrum Team collaborates on the details of Product Backlog item
    * Scrum Team decides how and when refinement is done
    * usually consumes no more than 10% of the capacity of the Development Team
* items that can be "Done" within one Sprint are "Ready" for selection in a Sprint Planning
* Development Team is responsible for all estimates
* Monitoring Progress Toward Goals
    * Product Owner tracks this total work remaining at least every Sprint Review
    * burn-downs, burn-ups, or cumulative flows

### Sprint Backlog
* set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint
    * plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal
    * makes visible all the work necessary to meet the Sprint Goal
* includes at least one high priority process improvement from Retrospective
    * remark: it has to be added to Spring Backlog not Product Backlog
* only the Development Team can change it during a Sprint
* Monitoring Sprint Progress
    * at least every Daily Scrum to project the likelihood of achieving the Sprint Goal

### Increment
* sum of all items completed during a Sprint + value of the increments of all previous Sprints
* meets the definition of "Done"
* Increment is useable, so a Product Owner may choose to immediately release it
    
### Definition of "Done"
* Development Team must define a definition of "Done"
    * if not a convention of the development organization
* everyone must understand what "Done" means
* definitions of "Done" will expand to include more stringent criteria for higher quality
* when many Development Teams are working on a single product all Development Teams 
must have a definition of "Done" that makes their combined work potentially releasable
* use to assess when work is complete on the product Increment
* guides the Development Team in knowing how many Product Backlog items it can select during a Sprint Planning
* ensures artifact transparency
